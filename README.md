# Abercrombie-Exercise-1

Exercise 1: Consuming RESTful API data

## Below are major key points which I have done in the excercise:
- Used handlerbar for template rendering.
- Created `commonFunctions.js` file to write all the common methods.
- User management methods are written in `manageUsers.js`.
- Shown loader and written api error handling code as well.
- Used `fetch` api to make api request and apart from that I have pure Vanilla JavaScript for excercise. Although I am sufficient in JQuery as well.
- Use flex layout for styling and responsiveness.
- Added comments to provide the information about methods.
- Added 4 test cases and for writing test cases I have used `cypress`. 

## Below are the steps to run the application:
- Open terminal and navigate to `app` directory.
- Run `npm i` to install node modules
- Run `npm start` to launch server
- Navigate to browser and open url `http://localhost:3000`


## Below are the steps to run test cases:
- Open terminal and navigate to `cypress-test-cases` directory
- Run `npx cypress open` and it will launch cypress window
- Click on `user.js` in cypress window to run the test cases
